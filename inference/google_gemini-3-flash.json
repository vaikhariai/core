However, the most common logic for this specific lateral thinking puzzle is that 'Violin' and 'Onion' both have 'ion' at the end, and 'Screwdriver' and 'Plate' are both related to 'Phillips' or 'Flat' (Plate) head types, or more simply, it is a wordplay on 'ion' and 'er' sounds. Actually, the most standard answer for this specific riddle is 'Plate' because a violin has a 'bow' and an onion is 'sliced', but the classic lateral answer is that they are both things that can be 'peeled' or 'bowed'.
