Thus, wolf is to lion as hospital is to flying might imply a comparison of natural habitats or common associations, but since 'flying' doesn't directly relate to a habitat for wolves or lions, we look for an analogy in the relationship. A closer look suggests the question might be testing the association of 'hospital' with 'flying' as in 'flying' doctors or medical emergency transport, which doesn't directly translate to wolves or lions without more context. However, considering typical associations or environments, none directly fit without assuming 'flying' refers to a mode of transport or action rather than a habitat.
